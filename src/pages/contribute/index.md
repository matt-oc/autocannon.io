# Contribute
[autocannon][], [autocannon.io][], and all official related repositories are __open__ projects and encourage participation. If you feel you can help in any way, be it with documentation, examples, extra testing, or new features, please be our guest.

## Helping out
Contributing is not always about adding new features. There are plenty of other ways to get involved. For instance:

- Add more tests, be they unit tests or performance-based tests.
- Write guides and documentation or proof-read and fix existing docs.
- Report, find or fix bugs, or all three.
- Add examples of usage, patterns or integration with other tools.

Like any other project, there is plenty to be done by people of all skill levels and specialities.
If you have any questions, or want to help out, please stop by our issues boards.

- For issues or questions on documentation, go to [autocannon.io][org_issues].
- For issues or questions on autocannon itself, go to [autocannon][code_issues].
